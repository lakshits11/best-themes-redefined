## Recommended Settings for the Best Experience 🔧💡⚙️

To make the most of Best Themes Redefined, we recommend configuring the following settings:

- **Use Nerd Font** ✒️: Best Themes Redefined truly shines when paired with a Nerd Font. Install a Nerd Font of your choice, such as Fira Code Nerd Font or JetBrains Mono Nerd Font, and set it as your editor's font family to unlock the full visual potential of the themes. 💪🔤

- **Enable Ligatures**: Ligatures are a typographic feature that combine two or more characters into a single glyph. We recommend enabling ligatures for an enhanced coding experience.

To further enhance your productivity and coding experience, we recommend these additional VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'JetbrainsMono Nerd Font', 'FiraCode Nerd Font', 'Hack Nerd Font', 'monospace'",
  "editor.smoothScrolling": true,
  "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "'JetbrainsMono Nerd Font', 'FiraCode Nerd Font', 'Hack Nerd Font', 'monospace'",
  "terminal.integrated.lineHeight": 1.5,
